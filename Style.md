* File names: lower_case.
* Indentation: two spaces when scoping, 4 spaces when continuing a line.
* Use no-parenthesis access (plain fields / getter or setter) when possible.
* Sort methods that are only called once in topological order.
* Trailing underscores for members that shouldn't be accessed from outside the class.
* Prefer Map and Set over plain objects.
