  <p>
    No registration is neccessary, and there's nothing to download or install.

  <div class="warning">
    Temporary warning: this app is in testing mode.
    Maps might be deleted at any point, and the connection might even fail during an edit.
  </div>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <h3>Simple</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Mipui</em> employs a limited but expressive set of tools, avoiding the bloat that exists in some other map editors while still remaining rich enough for most everyday gaming needs.
  </p>
  <h3>Real-time collaboration</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Mipui</em> has real-time collaboration between multiple authors.
    Just share the link with someone else and watch their edits live.
    No registration necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also possible to share a read-only view of the map, so that maps you create can easily be shared with any number of total strangers - aka the Internet.
  </p>
  <h3>Friendly</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Mipui</em> contains a lot of small features beyondf just tools that help with worry-free editing, including undo/redo support, the ability to resize the grid without deleting existing content, and zoom and pan tools.
  </p>
  <h3>Cloud storage</h3>
  <p>
    Every *Mipui* map is automatically saved to the cloud every few seconds, and will remain there forever.

    <em>Mipui</em> was inspired by many things, but first and foremost is <a href="http://deepnight.net/tools/tabletop-rpg-map-editor/">ANAmap by Sébastien Bénard</a>.
    In fact, <em>Mipui</em> started from me using his app and thinking "oh this is cool, but I wish it had just a few more features... I wonder if I can do that myself."
