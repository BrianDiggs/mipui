    <h1>Mipui Business Plan</h1>
    <p>
      Mipui is a hobby project ran by one person in his free time. Currently the operating expanses are negligible. Until that changes, no monetization is planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      If monetization is ever added, though, I'll strive to make it as unobtrusive as possible and without limiting existing features to only paying customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For anyone still concerned about Mipui becoming for-pay or blocked or abandoned for some reason, keep in mind Mipui is an open-source project - which means others can bring up independent copies of the app on their own servers.
