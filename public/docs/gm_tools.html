    <h1>Mipui Game Master Tools</h1>
    <p>
      When a user loads a Mipui map, that can either be in read/write mode (in
      which case the address looks like
      /index.html?mid=something&amp;secret=something) or read-only mode (in which
      case the address lacks the &amp;secret=something part). GM tools appear
      differently in the two modes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The hide / reveal tools</em> will overlay the cell with solid black in
      read-only mode, and translucent overlay in read/write mode. The basic tool
      will just show/hide a single cell, but there are buttons to show/hide the
      entire map, and a tool which reveals all cells in line of sight from the
      selected cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The GM note tool</em> will create text which is invisible in read-only
      mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The hidden secret door tool</em> will create a secret door which is
      invisible in read-only mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The region tool</em> will create a translucent overlay on the cell which
      is invisible in read-only mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>GM tools are not cheat-proof.</strong> The data is sent from the
      server, it's just not displayed to the user - so it's still possible to
      access it. Don't rely on it if you can't trust your viewers to not cheat.
