    <h1>The road to improving Mipui performance</h1>
    <em>Alon Mishne, May 2018</em>
    <p>
      <!-- Summary -->
      On December 2017 I created a poll to get a feel on what was important for the community. I had free-text fields and a recurring complaint there was performance on large maps, so I decided to tackle that. I knew it would be tricky, but I didn't know how much. This post gives a rough overview of the problem, the solution, and why it has difficult.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- What is Mipui -->
      <a href="https://www.mipui.net">Mipui</a> is a web app I'm developing, serving as a map editor for top-down grid-based maps, the type used in role-playing games such as D&amp;D. It also has other capabilities - saves to cloud, live updates shared across users, and more - but those are out of scope here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Mipui is flexible in map size -->
      From an early point in the development, the map size has been flexible. It defaults to 20x20, but you can change it to any size using the buttons on the side of the map. Later on I added a dedicated map resize button, which makes it easier to quickly resize to any size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Mipui is slow -->
      On my machine, the performance of 20x20 maps was smooth. By performance I mean the frames per second (FPS) when panning, zooming, hovering and drawing on the map. However things started to slow down as the maps got bigger. The slowdown was starting to get noticeable on 30x30 maps, and on 50x50 it was already getting into frustrating territory. So, this is the problem I set out to tackle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Target -->
      I didn't have a clear target when I started, but I was hoping I could get 100x100 maps running smoothly - I would consider that a success.
    </p>
    <h2>The Reason it was Slow</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Profiling results -->
      Initial profiling indicated what I suspected - the slowdown wasn't really caused by anything in my code, but was due to the time it took the browser to render the dom tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Large number of divs -->
      Mipui's grid is actually a collection of absolutely-positioned elements (all divs). Because Mipui actually places a wall grid cell in-between every two non-wall cells, the actual number of cells for a 20x20 map is 41x41. Worse, it's not just a single div per cell; every "layer" is assigned a div per cell, where layers are floor layer, wall layer, text layer etc. Empty layer values don't get a div so it's not really that bad, but the minimum number of divs per cell is 2: the floor layer and a "grid" layer, which is an invisible layer which is the one actually interacting with the mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Actual div count -->
      If I estimate an average of 1 non-empty layer per cell, which feels about right to me - so a total of 3 with the wall and grid layers - then the total number of divs for a 20x20 map is 41x41x3 = 5043. For a 50x50 map, that grows to 101x101x3 = 30603. My aspirational 100x100 map is 121203 divs, yet another order of magnitude over the already slow 50x50 map.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Comparison with other websites -->
      For reference, the number of elements on my Facebook homepage is 1866 and in my Gmail inbox-with-preview it's 4332, and they certainly don't all respond to mouse events and move around. So no wonder my high div count made things so slow - looks like typical websites don't have so many dynamic and interactive divs on-screen at once.
    </p>
    <h5 class="note">Side Note: Why Not Canvas?</h5>
    <p class="note">
      At the early stages of the project I considered using canvas instead of divs, but ended up ruling that out for various reasons which are outside the scope here. By the time I started the performance work mentioned in this post, changing it from divs to canvas would have been a considerable effort, and I wasn't entirely sure that it would solve the problem, and I was guessing it would also introduce new issues of its own.
    </p>
    <h2>Initial Attempts</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Small things -->
      Even before my December 2017 survey I tried to improve on performance, and started out with some small things. I prevented the map-resize button from moving every time you zoom or pan the map, instead only disappearing and reappearing a second after the zoom/pan was complete (big performance boost); I moved some interaction logic to only occur on each frame with requestAnimationFrame (small boost) and I cached some sizing values that I needed (barely noticeable boost). None of these was enough to really tackle the problem.
    </p>
    <h3>The will-change Property</h3>
    <p>
      <!-- what will-change is -->
      The next improvement attempt was trying to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change">will-change</a> property. According to the documentation it's supposed to give the browser a "heads-up" that something is about to change, but through experimentation I found out that in Chrome, what "will-change: contents" really does is cache the element to an image. That's actually the opposite of what I was expecting (if anything, it's anything that <em>isn't</em> about to change that should be cached), but it still seemed to have a lot of potential to be used for improving performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- using will-change -->
      I tried applying will-change at several resolutions, and finally found out that applying it to all layer elements resulted in a significant performance boost - around x2 FPS - particularly for zooming operations. Of course there were a few problems I had to solve, for example zooming in would actually lead to a blurry image, because of the image caching. So I had to forcefully remove and re-apply the will-change property after the zoom is complete to force the browser to re-cache the image. Another problem was that the map now had occasionally artifacts, which was very annoying. Still, x2 was too good to skip so I used it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- tiling for will-change -->
      Seeing the browser cache to image gave me an idea: what if I would tile the map - that is divide it to small submaps, sized 5x5 or 10x10 or something like that, and I'd apply will-change on that tile level, or tile layer level, instead of on entire map layers? That way I'll be able to edit small chunks at a time, while everything else is cached to image and has little performance impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- will-change + tiling results -->
      I did some non-trivial amount of work to implement the tiling approach, but at the end I tested it and it had no performance benefit. Still, that tiling idea felt powerful, so I left the code around.
    </p>
    <h2>Ultimate Solution: Caching Tiles to Images</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Reviving the tile caching idea -->
      So, along comes December 2017 and the performance complaints, and I'm thinking about the tiling idea again, this time more seriously. I'm already using <a href="https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image">a library that knows how to transform arbitrary dom to image</a> for exporting the map to PNG - could I utilize that with my tiling code to properly cache tiles to images? In theory the performance improvement could be dramatic. With 10x10 tiles, a 100x100 map will be around 100 image elements instead of 120k+ divs! Sure, a bunch of the tiles will be "active", but I already know that with just a few thousands elements thing run smoothly. So, I decided to go for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- The challenges -->
      Turns out there are two major challenges involved with this approach. The first is getting the tile boundary to be smooth in the presence of content that can cross tile boundaries - either explicitly with multi-cell elements (such as multi-cell text and tokens), or implicitly with the shadow dropped by wall elements, which is a crucial part of the design. The second challenge is performance: turns out the dom-to-image library I was using is way too slow to be used in this manner, taking up to a second for even small tiles, causing noticeable jank.
    </p>
    <h3>Challenge 1: Seamless Tile Boundaries</h3>
    <p>
      <!-- Why tiles must be hermetic -->
      I initially toyed with just letting multi-cell elements expand out of their containing tile. But this approach doesn't allow such a token to be inserted in between layers in the neighboring tile - it has to either be at the top or the bottom... so that was a no-go from the start. Tiles have to be hermetic - they must know how to draw their entire content and not let it overflow (unless it's guaranteed to be the top-most content in all neighboring tiles).
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Replicas -->
      Instead, I use what I nicknamed "replicas". When a cell is drawn to a tile, it also calculates which other tiles contain parts of it, and creates a replica of itself in the other tiles, with the same absolute location in the map. This results in two elements in different tiles but that share the same exact absolute location, leading to a smooth transition whiel still being hermetic per tile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Replicas for walls -->
      A similar approach is used for walls and other elements that cast shadows. If an element won't actually extend to a neighbor tile but its shadow will, it's also replicated in that tile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- 1px overlap -->
      The last problem was that the browser would often display a single-pixel "seam" in-between neighboring tiles. To counteract that, tiles actually expand a single pixels to all sides, and they overlap each other so that the seam is now always over such an overflow, and such invisible.
    </p>
