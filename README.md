**[Start creating a map now!](http://www.mipui.net/app)**

No registration is neccessary, and there's nothing to download or install.

## Features

### Simple

*Mipui* employs a limited but expressive set of tools, avoiding the bloat that exists in some other map editors while still remaining rich enough for most everyday gaming needs.

### Real-time collaboration

*Mipui* has real-time collaboration between multiple authors.
Just share the link with someone else and watch their edits live.
No registration necessary.

It's also possible to share a read-only view of the map, so that maps you create can easily be shared with any number of total strangers - aka the Internet.

### Friendly

*Mipui* contains a lot of small features beyondf just tools that help with worry-free editing, including undo/redo support, the ability to resize the grid without deleting existing content, and zoom and pan tools.

### Cloud storage

Every *Mipui* map is automatically saved to the cloud every few seconds, and will remain there forever.

### Developer information

*Mipui*'s implementation uses the following resources:

* [Firebase by Google](firebase.google.com)
* [DOM to Image by Anatolii Saienko](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image)
* [FireSaver.js by Eli Grey](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)
* [Game icons by Lorc, available on game-icons.net](game-icons.net)
* [Material icons by Google](https://material.io/icons/)

*Mipui* was inspired by many things, but first and foremost is [ANAmap by Sébastien Bénard](http://deepnight.net/tools/tabletop-rpg-map-editor/).
In fact, *Mipui* started from me using his app and thinking "oh this is cool, but I wish it had just a few more features... I wonder if I can do that myself."
